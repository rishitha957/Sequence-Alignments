# SGSeq Final Project

This repository contains the code for the SGSeq final project, which includes a Jupyter notebook (`sgseq_final_project.ipynb`) and a Java implementation of the NW algorithm.

## Structure

- `sgseq_final_project.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that contains various analyses and visualizations.
- `Java/src/nwalgorithm`: Contains the Java implementation of the NW algorithm.
  - `Nw.java`: The main code for the NW algorithm.
  - `Main.java`: Demonstrates how to run the NW algorithm.

## Prerequisites

- Python environment with Jupyter Notebook installed for running the `.ipynb` file.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run the Java code.

## Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. Navigate to the root directory of this project.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
